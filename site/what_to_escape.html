        <h1>this tells about what to use and how to use some spacial characters</h1>

        <p>
            if we use <and then we use > then it will be complete ignored by the browser because it will interpret every tag starting
        from less then sign as a tag
        same for & sign
        </p>

        <p>So we will use &lt; and &gt; to display signs <br>
        and &amp; 
        &copy;</p>

        <p>not&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;space
            <br>
            if size of browser is reduced then ordinary space will let the line to break into different word
            <br>
            &quot; so here comes &nbsp that will not allow line to get broken into words &quot;
            and 
        </p>

        <p>
            this <span>is how</span> you should give space between text in html
        </p>
